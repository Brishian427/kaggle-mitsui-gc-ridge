# Code Examples

This directory contains code examples demonstrating how critical technical challenges are addressed in the GC-Ridge pipeline.

## Files

- `nan_handling_example.py`: Examples of NaN handling strategies
- `temporal_leakage_prevention_example.py`: Examples of temporal leakage prevention
- `alignment_example.py`: Examples of data alignment and index management
- `overfitting_mitigation_example.py`: Examples of temporal overfitting mitigation

## Usage

These examples are standalone demonstrations of the techniques used in the pipeline. They can be run independently to understand how each challenge is addressed:

```bash
# Run individual examples
python technical_challenges_examples/nan_handling_example.py
python technical_challenges_examples/temporal_leakage_prevention_example.py
python technical_challenges_examples/alignment_example.py
python technical_challenges_examples/overfitting_mitigation_example.py
```

## Purpose

These examples serve as:
1. **Documentation**: Clear code examples showing how challenges are addressed
2. **Verification**: Demonstrates that proper safeguards are in place
3. **Education**: Shows the technical rigor applied to achieve results

## Related Documentation

For detailed explanations of these techniques, see `TECHNICAL_CHALLENGES.md` in the root directory of this project.
